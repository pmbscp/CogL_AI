# CogL_AI: Cognitive Load Simulation and Modeling

CogL-AI is a Python-based project that simulates multimodal cognitive data 
(behavioral, physiological, EEG, and self-report) to study and model cognitive load.

## Structure
- `data/` – sample simulated datasets  
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for analysis and modeling  
- `src/` – core Python scripts  

## Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CogL_AI.git
cd CogL_AI
pip install -r requirements.txt
